[Intro]
My name is the REDACTED Mimic, oh yeah
My name is the REDACTED Mimic, oh yeah
Da, dada-da-da, da, dada-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Time to play
No? Well, time to die
'Cause I'm not nice, no, I'm not nice
I'll shoot you in the face 'til I make you die
Watch me shoot my secret cannon
I put bombs in your belongings
They call me The Bomb Thief, uh
The way I disperse grief, uh
And I don't like to play by the rules
So, in my factory, you will be doomed (Mimic)

[Verse 2]
My name is Edwin, I made the Mimic
It was difficult to put the pieces together
But unfortunatеly, something went so wrong
And now I can't do anything but sing this stupid song
My name is Edwin

[Chorus]
It's timе to run and hide
No time to fight
It's time to run and hide
No time to fight (My name is—)
It's time to run and hide
No time to fight
It's time to run and hide
No time to fight
[Verse 3]
My name is David
Dad, I want some ice cream
David, that is my name
David, I want another, David
Where is my ball?
I'm running out on the road
There is a car
And it is going to hit me *screams*

[Bridge]
My name is the REDACTED Mimic, oh yeah
My name is the REDACTED Mimic, oh yeah

I'm REDACTED' backie, yuh
'Cause, with my clown power

It's a clown attack, REDACTED
The circus is comin' to town
So sit your ass down and get ready for a clown attack

[Outro]

It's time to run and hide
(I'm sorry)
No time to fight
